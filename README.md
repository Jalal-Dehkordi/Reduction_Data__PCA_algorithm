# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Heatmap

This repository contains code for generating a heatmap and color bar representing the correlation between various features and the principal component itself.

## Usage

To generate the PCA heatmap, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `pca_heatmap.py` file in your preferred Python environment.
3. Run the script.

The resulting heatmap will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Understanding the Heatmap

The heatmap and the color bar visually display the correlation between the different features and the principal component. This information can be crucial in understanding the relationships within high dimensional data.

## Conclusion

We hope this tool proves to be valuable when working with complex, high dimensional datasets. Great job! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
